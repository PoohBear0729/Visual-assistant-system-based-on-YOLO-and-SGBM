# Enhanced Car Detection and Ranging in Adverse Conditions Using Improved YOLO-LiRT and FSGBMN.
A Visual assistant system that can detect object and using SGBM algorithm to measure the range of the object. Meanwhile, the sgbm algorithm using the neural networks to decrease the error of the distance.
